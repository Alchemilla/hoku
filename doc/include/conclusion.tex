\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we discussed six star identification methods and their strengths and weaknesses.
A unified identification framework was created to describe all methods for fair analysis.
Portions that were interchangeable amongst all methods such as database access and centroid determination were
normalized or removed to focus on the star identification aspect itself.
To control the severity of our error, artificial images were generated.

The Angle method is the simplest of the six and has the fastest query step, but its runtime is heavily impacted by
the $\abs{R} = 1$ criterion and \Call{DMT}{} process.
The Dot Angle method is the fastest running method under no noise, but its accuracy is the most sensitive to varying
Gaussian noise and the slowest query step.
The Spherical Triangle method's accuracy is the least sensitive to varying Gaussian noise, but is the most sensitive
to varying amounts of false stars.
The Planar Triangle is on average faster than the Spherical Triangle method, but is also very sensitive to varying
amounts of false stars.
The Pyramid method is the fastest method given varying amounts of Gaussian noise \& false stars and is also the most
accurate given varying amounts of spikes, but is not able to achieve $100\%$ average accuracy due to its query step.
The Composite Pyramid method does not suffer from this inaccuracy problem, but does not achieve the same consistent
performance of the Pyramid or the triangle methods due to the number of filters implemented.

Overall, the Pyramid method handles both Gaussian noise and false stars the best in a reasonable amount of time.
