    The process of identifying stars is integral toward stellar based orientation determination in spacecraft.
    Star identification involves matching points in an image of the sky with stars in an astronomical catalog.
    A unified framework for identification was created and used to analyze the following:
    the Angle method, the Dot Angle method, the Spherical and Planar Triangle methods, the Pyramid method, and the
    Composite Pyramid method.
    Each method was presented an artificial image, and aspects that were interchangeable among each process were
    normalized.
    Given an image with false stars, the Pyramid method has the highest average accuracy and is the fastest of the six.
    Given an image where each star's true position is distributed randomly (Gaussian noise), the Spherical Triangle
    method's accuracy is the least sensitive.
