    Star identification is the process of mapping centroids in an image to stars in a catalog.
    Gottlieb's Angle method, Liebe's Dot Angle method, Cole and Crassidis's Spherical and Planar Triangle method,
    Motari's Pyramid method, and Toloei's Composite Pyramid method were modified to fit a general identification
    process.
    Each method was presented an artificial image, and aspects that were interchangeable among each process were
    normalized.
    Given an image of false stars, the Pyramid method has the highest average accuracy and is the fastest of the six.
    Given an image where each star's true position is distributed randomly (Gaussian noise), the Dot Angle method has
    the highest average accuracy but runs the second slowest.
    The fastest method with the 2nd highest average accuracy under Gaussian noise is the Pyramid method.
