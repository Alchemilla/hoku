\section{Related Work}\label{sec:relatedWork}
This section serves to give a brief overview of the different approaches to querying for constellations.
Additional survey papers have been published by Spratling~\cite{spratling:surveyStarIdentification} and
Br\"{a}tt~\cite{bratt:analysisStarIdentification}, but our research focuses on the specific area of constellation
queries (not image processing, attitude determination, or database searching) and describes each strategy within a
unified framework.

\nsubparagraph{Identification Classes}
The first main class of identification and the focus of this paper is the \textit{subgraph isomorphism} class.
Subgraph isomorphism is a NP complete problem which aims to find some 1-to-1 mapping between the vertices (points) in
two graphs (i.e.\ the database and the image) if it exists~\cite{scott:graphIsomorphismProblem}.
This involves describing and mapping sets of points between both the database and image in terms of various features
relative to each other.

The second class of identification is the \textit{pattern recognition} class.
In contrast to subgraph isomorphism class, the pattern recognition class commonly deals with larger sets of points
within some defined field-of-view and matches patterns rather than features.
Pattern formation typically involves 2D binary matrices (grids), where `1' occupies a cell with a point and `0' occupies
a cell without one~\cite{padgett:gridAlgorithm}.

%Another notable attempt toward pattern formation utlizes Delaunay Triangulation, as seen from Miri~\cite
%
%Some notable approaches utilize Padgett's~\cite{padgett:gridAlgorithm} and Lee's~\cite{lee:modifiedGridAlgorithm}
%use of binary matrices (grids) to construct patterns, Lindsey~\cite{lindsey:neuralNetworkMethods} and
%Alvelda's~\cite{alvelda:neuralNetworkStar} use of neural networks to optimize pattern similarity, and
%Paladugu's~\cite{paladugu:geneticAlgorithms} use of a genetic algorithm to solve the same pattern similarity problem.

\nsubparagraph{Recursive Property}
Recall that the lost-in-space condition specifies that we do not have any information about the spacecraft's attitude
prior to starting our query.
For the majority of a star tracker's operation though, this constraint can be relaxed to allow for the use of
\textit{recursive} constellation querying.
Recursive strategies possess an attitude recorded at time $t$, and perform another query at a later time $t + dt$.
Two strategies proposed by Samaan (SP-Search and SNA) reduce the amount of candidate points from the database that could
map to query points from the image~\cite{samaan:recursiveMode}.

\nsubparagraph{Features}
Each point has a position associated with it, be it from a star database or from the image.
Using this position, the most common feature is the interstar angle between two points, first utilized by
Gottlieb to identify sets of three points with three interstar angles~\cite{gottlieb:spacecraftAttitudeDetermination}.
Notable strategies with geometric functions utilizing these angles were proposed by:
Groth~\cite{groth:patternMatchingMethod}, Cole \&
Crassidus~\cite{coleAndCrassidis:sphericalTriangleMethod,coleAndCrassidis:planarTriangleMethod}, and
Lang~\cite{lang:astrometryDotNet}.
Another common feature is the interior angle between three points, where one point exists as a vertex to two other
points.
Liebe uses this in conjunction with interstar angles~\cite{liebe:starTrackersAttitudeDetermination}.

%Each star has a position associated with it, be it from a star catalog or from the image.
%Using this position, the most common feature is the interstar angle between two stars, first utilized by Gottlieb to
%identify sets of three stars with three angles~\cite{gottlieb:spacecraftAttitudeDetermination}.
%Additional geometric functions utilizing these interstar angles were proposed by: Groth (using the log of the sum of
%three interstar angles in a trio~\cite{groth:patternMatchingMethod}), Cole \& Crassidus (treating the angles of a
%star trio as sides to a triangle, and computing the triangle's area and
%torque)~\cite{coleAndCrassidis:sphericalTriangleMethod, coleAndCrassidis:planarTriangleMethod}, and Lang (using the
%differences in interstar angle between a star quad in a localized coordinate system)~\cite{lang:astrometryDotNet}.
%Another common feature is the interior angle between three stars, where one star exists as a vertex to two other stars.
%Liebe uses this in conjuction with interstar angles~\cite{liebe:starTrackersAttitudeDetermination}.

%This feature is used solely by Rousseau (the sine of the closest two closest stars of a trio)
%~\cite{rousseau:starRecognitionAPS}
%and Samaan (the interior angles of three stars)
%~\cite{samaan:nondimensionalStarIdentification},
%and in conjunction with the interstar angles by Liebe~\cite{liebe:starTrackersAttitudeDetermination}.

Each point also has a brightness attached it, a feature less commonly used due to large variance in measurement.
Spratling describes two early strategies to take advantage of this feature.
Scholl proposed the usage of this to remove the need for ambiguity after matching subsets with angular features
~\cite{scholl:starFieldIdentification}.
Ketchum later introduced the second sequential filtering algorithm, which identifies two points using their brightness
in comparison to the common trio required of angle strategies~\cite{ketchum:onboardStarIdentification}.
More recent work toward integrating brightness more heavily has been performed by Zhang et.
al~\cite{zhang:brightnessReferenced}.

\nsubparagraph{Database Access}
The naive approach to searching for matching features in a subgraph isomorphism approach is to perform a
linear search across an entire set in a database and search for matching subsets.
%Early star identification strategies focused on reducing the size of the relation to be searched, rather than the search
%process itself.
In 1996, Quine (according to Spratling) was the first to reduce the database search time from linear to log time
using a binary search tree~\cite{quine:fastAutonomousStarAcquistion}.
The following year Mortari's "Search-Less Algorithm" was introduced, which utilizes $k$-vectors to search a relation
independent of its size~\cite{mortari:kVectorApproach}.

    Given an image $I$, this process returns a function $h$ whose domain is some subset of the image $b$ and whose
    codomain is the stellar database, $K$.
    In the event all subsets are exhausted, the function $h: b \srightarrow \emptyset$ is returned (not depicted).

\nsubparagraph{Mapping}
To identify a point in an image is to pair it with some point in a database.
Gottlieb's strategy used a voting approach to remove the ambiguity after identifying a single point
pair~\cite{gottlieb:spacecraftAttitudeDetermination},
which was later generalized by Kolomenkin to vote for every point in the image~\cite{kolomenkin:geometricVoting}.
The direct match test was proposed by Needleman (according to Tappe), which determines the likelihood of a map based
on how many points from each frame align with the attitude formed by the map~\cite{needelman:stellarAttitudeAcquisition}.
In an effort to avoid the mapping processes above, Anderson (according to Spratling) proposed the use of storing
permutations of point subsets instead of combinations at the expense of storage~\cite{anderson:autonomousStarSensing}.
The use of neural networks~\cite{lindsey:neuralNetworkMethods,alvelda:neuralNetworkStar} and genetic
algorithms~\cite{paladugu:geneticAlgorithms} have also been proposed to optimize the mapping process.
