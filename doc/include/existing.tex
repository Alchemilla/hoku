\section{Star Identification Methods}\label{sec:starIdentificationMethods}
Six different approaches to star identification are described in this section.
Each algorithm was constructed according to their pseudocode, and modified to fit a general identification flow
for easy comparison.
For instances where the pseudocode does not specify a step, processes were borrowed from other algorithms.

\subsection{Generic Identification Method}\label{subsec:genericIdentificationMethod}
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering{
    \input{include/floats/generic-identification}
    \caption{
    Flowchart depicting a general star identification process.
    Given an image $I$, this process returns a bijection $f$ between some subset of the input $b$ and a subset of the
    catalog $r$.
    } \label{figure:genericIdentificationMethodFlowchart}
    }
\end{figure}

Each identification method is presented with an image $I$ of size $n$ containing all the stars in the image reference,
as well as a catalog of known stars $C$.
All stars in $I$ exist in the body frame $\iFrame$, and all stars in $K$ exist in the inertial frame $\kFrame$.
The goal of each method is to find some bijection between the \textit{subset} of the image stars $b$ and a subset
of the catalog stars $r$.
This function will be denoted as $f$.
Complete identification of the all stars in each image is not the focus.

\begin{subequations}
    Every algorithm starts with some combination from all possible $d$ combinations of $n$ stars $C(n, d)$, where
    $d = $ the size of the image subset that specific identification method uses.
    The subset of stars from the image is selected using one of these combinations.
    For an identification method that uses $d=2$ stars to determine the mapping in an image of $n=4$ stars, the
    combinations of $I$ are:
    \begin{align}
        C(4, 2) \text{ of } I &= \set{\set{\vv{I_1}, \vv{I_2}}, \set{\vv{I_1}, \vv{I_3}}, \ldots,
        \set{\vv{I_3}, \vv{I_4}}} \\
        C(4, 2) \text{ of } I &= \set{ b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_6 }
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{subequations}
    There exists a set $K^d$, composed of $d$ sized sets of all possible combinations (or permutations) of stars
    from the catalog $C$.
    Using certain features of the image star subset, the entire $K^d$ set is filtered to a set of catalog star
    candidates $R$.
    This is known as the catalog query step, or the $K^d$ filtering step.
    Referencing the same $d=2$ identification method as before, an image subset $b = \set{\vv{I_1}, \vv{I_2}}$ may
    yield the candidates in~\autoref{eq:catalogCandidateExample}:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:catalogCandidateExample}
        R &= \set{ \set{\vv{K_{104}}, \vv{K_{899}}}, \set{\vv{K_{7622}}, \vv{K_{7771}}}, \ldots) } \\
        R &= \set{ r_1, r_2, \ldots }
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Through some filter process and/or criteria for $R$ itself, a single set $r$ from the catalog star candidates is
eventually selected.
This may require going through multiple catalog candidate sets and repeating the catalog query step.
This is known as the $R$ filtering step.
For a process with an $R$ criterion of $|R| = 1$ and a filter process of choosing a sole element, the following sequence
of events may occurring before finding a single $r$ set.
\begin{align*}
    &t = 1, \text{ query with } b^{(1)}, \text{ get } R^{(1)} = \{\vv{r_{11}}, \vv{r_{12}}, \ldots\}. \\
    &t = 2, \ \abs{ R^{(1)} } \neq 1, \text{ criterion not met. } \\
    &t = 3, \text{ choose new image subset } b^{(2)}. \\
    &t = 4, \text{ query with } b^{(2)}, \text{ get } R^{(2)} = \{\vv{r_{21}}\}. \\
    &t = 5, \ \abs{ R^{(2)} } = 1, \text{ criterion met. } \\
    &t = 6, \text{ return } r, r \in R^{(2)} \left(\text{sole element in } R^{(2)} \right).
\end{align*}

From here, a bijection $f: b \rightarrow r$ is determined that maps each star found in the image star subset to a
single star in the catalog candidate set.
If we are not confident in $f$ at this point, another image star subset is chosen and the process is repeated.
If we are confident in $f$, then $b$, $r$, and $f$ are returned.
This process is detailed in~\autoref{figure:genericIdentificationMethodFlowchart}.
In the event no map can be determined, an error is raised and the function $f: b \rightarrow \emptyset$ is returned
instead (not depicted).

\subsection{Angle Method}\label{subsec:angleMethod}
In 1978, Gottlieb developed the Polygon Angular Matching method~\cite{Angle,AnalysisUncompensated}.
This method has been adjusted to fit the general flow posed in~\autoref{subsec:genericIdentificationMethod}.

Given a set of stars from the image $I$, $d = 2$ stars are selected to obtain the $b$ set.
The selection order is governed by lines (2) and (3) in~\autoref{algorithm:angleIdentification}.
This fixes the star $\vv{b_1}$ in $b$ for $|I| = n$ image star subset selections, while constantly changing
$\vv{b_2}$ for every new $b$ choice.
An example sequence of pairs is depicted below for $n = 3$ stars.
\begin{equation}
    C(3, 2) \text{ of } I = \left(\set{\vv{I_1}, \vv{I_2}}, \set{\vv{I_1},\vv{I_3}}, \set{\vv{I_2},\vv{I_1}},
    \ldots \right)
\end{equation}

The catalog query step searches for pairs in the $K^2$ catalog whose angular separation is close to the angular
separation of the image star subset.
For the image star subset, the origin of the angular separation calculation $\theta(b)$ is the focal point of the lens
itself.
For a catalog star candidate set, the origin of this calculation $\theta(r)$ is the center of the Earth.
To obtain $R$, the predicate $P_\theta(r, b)$ is used to filter the $K^2$ catalog:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:angleRequirement}
    P_{\theta}(r, b) : \left\lvert \theta(r) - \theta(b)\right\rvert < 3 \sigma_\theta
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\theta}$ represents the deviation of the uncertainty between the $\theta$ computation from star sensor
measurements and the same $\theta$ computation from points defined in the catalog.
Assuming the noise follows a Gaussian distribution, it follows that 99.7\% of all true pairs will be within this range.

Once the catalog candidates are obtained, the $R$ criteria for the Angle method is $|R| = 1$.
This process is repeated until only one candidate exists in $R$.
This sole element $\vv{R_1}$ is then selected to be $r$.

\begin{subequations}
    To determine the most likely bijection $f$, Needlemen specifies the use of a \textit{direct match test}
    (DMT)~\cite{Tappe, DMT}.
    Given an image star pair $b$ and a catalog star pair $r$ for, the following is proposed:
    \begin{equation}
    f_1 : f_1\left(\vv{b_1}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_1}, f_1\left(\vv{b_2}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_2}
    \end{equation}
    Wahba's problem is then solved using the TRIAD method to obtain a rotation $A_1$ between the image and catalog
    frames.
    This process is repeated for the other possible permutation to obtain a second rotation $A_2$:
    \begin{equation}
        f_2 : f_2\left(\vv{b_1}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_2}, f_2\left(\vv{b_2}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_1}
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
The most likely attitude is determined by the \Call{FPO}{} method, which returns how many stars from $I$ align with
$K$ given $A_1$ or $A_2$.
The bijection with the most stars is then returned.
If all bijections return sets with the same size, then we are not confident in any of our choices and
return the function $f: f\left(\vv{x}\righ) \rightarrow \emptyset $.

%The \Call{FPO}{} method determines the number of stars from $I$ in the body frame $\iFrame$ align with $C$ in the
%inertial frame $\kFrame$.
%More stars are selected from the catalog that are near the original subset $r$, denoted as $P$.
%The \Call{FPO}{} method then filters out stars in set $P$ that do not overlay with some star in $I'$, the image set
%rotated by some rotation $q$.
%An additional term $\sigma_o$ is defined, which defines how selective this filter.
%$\sigma_o$ can also be thought of as an assumption of the noise associated with the rotation $q$.

Accessing the catalog is the most expensive operation for all of the identification methods.
Consequently, the running time of this algorithm $T_{angle}$ can be described in terms of the number of queries and
the number of entries that exist in the $K^2$ catalog.
There exist $2n^2$ catalog accesses at worst, requiring two catalog accesses (query step and \Call{DMT}{} calls) for
each combination of pairs in $I$.
The time to access the $K^2$ catalog is described by the second term, which is the time to query a B tree
indexed database of size $m_2$.
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:complexityAnglePart1}
%    T_{angle} = \bigO\left(C(n, 2) \cdot n \cdot \log(m_{angle}) \right)
%\end{equation}
%We expand the combination term to get:
%\begin{equation}
%    C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2}{4} - \frac{n}{4}
%\end{equation}
%~\autoref{eq:complexityAnglePart1} then simplifies to~\autoref{eq:complexityAngle}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:complexityAngle}
    T_{angle} = \bigO\left( n^2 \cdot \log(m_2) \right)
\end{equation}

All methods associated with the Angle method are written in~\autoref{algorithm:angleIdentification}.

\subsection{Dot Angle Method}\label{subsec:dotAngleMethod}
In 1995, Liebe developed the Liebe Star ID method~\cite{Survey,AnalysisUncompensated}.
This method has been adjusted to fit the general flow posed in~\autoref{subsec:genericIdentificationMethod}.

Starting with an image $I$, a central star $\vv{b_c}$ is selected.
A new central star selection does not involve generating permutations like the Angle method, rather it involves
iterating through $I$ in a sequential manner.
The two closest stars in the image to the central star are selected next, denoted as $\vv{b_{c1}}$ and $\vv{b_{c2}}$.

The catalog query step searches for trios in the $\bar{K^3}$ catalog whose features are close to the same features of
the image subset.
Unlike the Angle method's $K^d$ set, $\bar{K^d}$ is defined to be all \textit{permutations} of size $d$ rather than
combinations.
These features are defined as the angular separation between the first closest star and the central star
($\theta\left(\vv{b_{c1}}, \vv{b_c}\right)$ vs. $ \theta\left(\vv{r_{c1}}, \vv{r_c}\right)$), the
angular separation between the second closest star and the central star, ($\theta\left(\vv{b_{c2}},
\vv{b_c}\right) $ vs. $\theta\left(\vv{r_{c2}}, \vv{r_c}\right)$),
and the angular separation between the two closest stars with the central star as the origin instead of the Earth or 
focal point ($\phi(b) $ vs. $ \phi(r)$).
To obtain $R$, the predicate $P_{\theta, \phi}$ is used to filter the $\bar{K^3}$ catalog:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        P_{\theta, \phi} (r, b): \left\lvert \theta(\vv{r_{c1}}, \vv{r_c}) - \theta(\vv{b_{c1}}, \vv{b_c})\right\rvert
        &< 3 \sigma_{\theta} \ \land \\ \left\lvert \theta(\vv{r_{c2}}, \vv{r_c}) - \theta(\vv{b_{c2}}, 
        \vv{b_c})\right\rvert &< 3 \sigma_{\theta} \ \land \\ \left\lvert \phi(r) - \phi(b)\right\rvert &< 3 
        \sigma_\phi \ \land \\\theta(\vv{r_{c1}}, \vv{r_c}) &< \theta(\vv{r_{c2}}, \vv{r_c})
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\theta}$ and $\sigma_{\phi}$ represent the deviation of measurement to catalog uncertainty of
$\theta$ and $\phi$ computations respectively.

After finding an $R$ that meets the same $R$ criterion as the Angle method, the bijection:
\begin{equation}
    f: f\left(\vv{b_1}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_1}, f\left(\vv{b_2}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_2}, f\left(\vv{b_3}\right)
    \rightarrow \vv{r_3}
\end{equation}
is constructed and returned.
By imposing the last term in  predicate $P_{\theta, \phi}$ at query time (last term in) and by searching all
permutations instead of combinations, the need for a star mapping procedure (e.g.\ Needleman's direct match test) is
no longer required.
Storing permutations does increase the storage required for the $\bar{K^3}$ catalog though, which begs the question,
"Does this space tradeoff result in a significant time increase?".

%The star trios in the catalog star candidates represent potential catalog maps for the image star trio $(b_i, b_j,
%b_c)$.
%Liebe's original method states that this process should be repeated for all stars in the image, meaning that all
%stars will be the central star at one point
%By the end, each star in the image will have accrued a set of possible catalog matches $Y$.
%The complete $I \rightarrow R$ map is found by picking the most frequent catalog star appearing in each $Y$
%set~\cite{DotAngle,AnalysisUncompensated}.
%
%To more closely follow the generic star identification flow, we modified the Dot Angle method to not store $Y$,
%requiring that only one central star choice is needed to acquire a total match.
%If a confident match is not found by the first central star, then the search process will be repeated until such a
%match is found.

        \EndFunction
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The running time of this algorithm $T_{dot}$ is depicted below, again described in terms of the number of queries
and $\bar{K^3}$ catalog entries:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dotComplexity}
    T_{dot} = O\left( n \cdot \log(\bar{m_3}) \right)
\end{equation}
where $\bar{m_3}$ is the size of the $\bar{K^3}$ catalog.

This entire method is described in~\autoref{algorithm:dotAngleIdentification}.

\subsection{Spherical Triangle Method}\label{subsec:sphericalTriangleMethod}
In 2004, Cole and Crassidus developed the Spherical Triangle method~\cite{Spherical}.
This method has been adjusted to fit the general flow posed in~\autoref{subsec:genericIdentificationMethod}.

Given a set of stars from the image $I$, $d = 3$ stars are selected to obtain the $b$ set.
The selection order is governed in a similar manner to the Angle method, but with $C(n, 3)$ instead of
$C(n, 2)$.
The star $\vv{b_1}$ is fixed in $b$ for $n^2$ image star subset selections, the star $\vv{b_2}$ is fixed for
$n$ selections, and the last star $\vv{b_3}$ is constantly changed for every new $b$ choice.

The catalog query step searches for trios in the $K^3$ catalog whose spherical area and moment
are close to the spherical area and moment of the image star subset.
For the image star subset, the spherical area and moment are represented as $a(b)$ and $\imath(b)$ respectively.
For the catalog star candidate set, these same features are represented as $a(r)$ and $\imath(r)$.
To obtain $R$, the predicate $P_{a, \imath}(r, b)$ is used to filter the $K^3$ catalog:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        P_{a, \imath}(r, b) : \abs{ a(r) - a(b)} &< 3\sigma_{a}
        \ \land \\ \abs{\imath(r) - \imath(b)} &< 3\sigma_{\imath}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_a$ and $\sigma_\imath$ represent the deviation of measurement to catalog uncertainty of spherical area
and moment computations respectively.

Unlike the previous two methods, the $R$ criterion of $|R| = 1$ not being met does not lead to an immediate new
selection of $b$.
Instead, the candidate set itself is reduced by \textit{pivoting} until the criterion is met or pivots can no longer
be performed.
The procedure stars by querying the catalog again for a second set of catalog candidate sets $\bar{R}$ with a
different image star subset $\bar{b} = \left(\vv{b_i}, \vv{b_j}, \vv{\beta}\right)$.
In $\bar{b}$, the first two stars are held constant while the third star is swapped with another in $I$ that was not
already used in this specific pivot.
All star trios in the initial search that do not match a trio in the second search by \textit{two stars} (a partial
match) are removed from the initial search candidate star set.
A pivot uses at most $n$ additional catalog accesses, but prevents wasting a catalog candidate set that may contain the
correct $r$ set for the given $b$.

\begin{subequations}
    Cole and Crassidus do not specify identification steps, so Needleman's DMT process is used to complete the star
    identification process.
    Given an image star trio and a catalog star trio, an bijection is proposed:
    \begin{equation}
        f_1 : f_1\left(\vv{b_1}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_1}, f_1\left(\vv{b_2}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_2},
        f_1\left(\vv{b_{3}}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_3}
    \end{equation} \label{eq:trianglePossibleMaps}
    The TRIAD method only uses two vector observations from each frame, meaning that the $\vv{b_3} \rightarrow \vv{r_3}$
    pairing is disregarded as the first rotation $A_1$ is computed.
    This process is repeated for all 5 other possible bijections to get $A_2, A_3, \dots, A_6$.
    \begin{align}
        f_2 &: f_2\left(\vv{b_1}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_1}, f_2\left(\vv{b_2}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_3},
        f_2\left(\vv{b_3}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_2} \\
        f_3 &: f_3\left(\vv{b_1}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_2}, f_3\left(\vv{b_2}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_1},
        f_3\left(\vv{b_3}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_3} \\
        f_4 &: f_4\left(\vv{b_1}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_2}, f_4\left(\vv{b_2}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_3},
        f_4\left(\vv{b_3}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_1} \\
        f_5 &: f_5\left(\vv{b_1}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_3}, f_5\left(\vv{b_2}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_1},
        f_5\left(\vv{b_3}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_2} \\
        f_{6} &: f_6\left(\vv{b_1}\right) \rightarrow r_4, f_6\left(\vv{b_2}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_2},
        f_6\left(\vv{b_3}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_1}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
For all six attitudes, the bijection yielding the most aligned stars is returned.

The running time of this algorithm $T_{sphere}$ is depicted below in terms of the number of queries and the number of
entries in the $K^3$ catalog.
At most, this requires $2n^4$ catalog access: $n^3$ for each combination of trios in $I$, $n$ potential catalog
accesses incurred for each pivot, and an additional $n^4$ queries with each \Call{DMT}{} call.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sphereComplexity}
    T_{sphere} = \bigO\left( n^4 \cdot \log (m_3) \right)
\end{equation}
where $m_3$ represents the size of the $K^3$ catalog.

This entire method is described in~\autoref{algorithm:triangleIdentification}.

\subsection{Planar Triangle Method}\label{subsec:coleAndCrassidus'sPlanarTriangleMethod}
In 2006, Cole and Crassidus developed the Planar Triangle method~\cite{Planar}.

This is identical to their Spherical Triangle method, with the exception that each image trio is represented as a
planar triangle instead of a spherical one.
The main area of interest here is whether or not this feature change results in a more efficent query step and/or
a more noise tolerant process.

% Mortari introduced the use of \textit{search-less} catalog access using the $k$-vector approach, but this will not be
% discussed in this paper.
\subsection{Pyramid Method}\label{subsec:pyramidMethod}
In 2004, Mortari developed the Pyramid method~\cite{Pyramid}.
This method has been adjusted to fit the general flow posed in~\autoref{subsec:genericIdentificationMethod}.

Given a set of stars from the image $I$, $d = 3$ stars are selected to obtain the $b$ set.
The selection order is governed by lines (18), (19), and (20) in~\autoref{algorithm:pyramidIdentification}.
As opposed to the selection order of the Angle and triangle methods, the $\vv{b_1}$ star in $b$ is no longer fixed
for $n$ or $n^2$ image star subset selections.
This is meant to avoid the persistence of badly recorded or false stars for more than a few combinations.
An example sequence of trios is depicted below for $n = 5$ stars.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        C(5, 3) \text{ of } I = ( \set{\vv{I_1}, \vv{I_2}, \vv{I_3}}, &\set{\vv{I_2}, \vv{I_3}, \vv{I_4}}, \\
        &\set{\vv{I_3}, \vv{I_4}, \vv{I_5}}, \ldots )
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The catalog query step stars with three queries based on $b$: pairs from the $K^2$ catalog whose angular separation
is close to the angular separation of $\set{\vv{b_i}, \vv{b_j}}$, pairs from the catalog whose angular separation
is close to the angular separation of $\set{\vv{b_i}, \vv{b_k}}$, and pairs from the catalog whose angular separation is
close to the angular separation of $\set{ b_j, \vv{b_k} }$.
Each of these sets are denoted as $T_{ij}, T_{ik}$ and $T_{jk}$ respectively.
These sets are then flattened from sets of pairs to just a single set of stars (\Call{FC}{}
in~\autoref{algorithm:pyramidIdentification}) and the difference of two flattened sets identify a single star.
For the sets of pairs $T_{ij}, T_{jk}$ found by querying with $P_\theta$ and $\set{\vv{b_i}, \vv{b_j}},
\set{\vv{b_j}, \vv{b_k}}$, the common star between each $b$ set is $\vv{b_j}$.
An example of finding catalog candidates for $b_j$ with this method is given below:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        T_{ij} \gets& \set{ \set{\vv{K_{1123}}, \vv{K_{9001}}}, \set{\vv{K_{8234}}, \vv{K_{33}}} } \\
        T_{jk} \gets& \set{ \set{\vv{K_{612}}, \vv{K_{1123}}}, \set{\vv{K_{33}}, \vv{K_{345}}} } \\
        T_j =& \  \Call{FC}{T_{ij}, T_{jk}} = \set{\vv{K_{1123}}, \vv{K_{33}}}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$R$ is found by repeating the process above for $T_i$ and $T_k$, and generating all possible sequences.
This is depicted in the \Call{Query}{} function in~\autoref{algorithm:pyramidIdentification}.

After finding an $R$ where $\abs{T_i} = \abs{T_j} = \abs{T_k} = 1$ (same criterion as Angle and Dot Angle), a
verification step is performed.
A different star from the image $\vv{\beta}$ is selected and the query step is performed for each distinct combination
of $b$ and $\vv{\beta}$.
If $\abs{T_\beta} \neq 1$, then verification step has failed and another image subset is selected.
Otherwise, the bijection $f : f\left(\vv{b_1}\right) \rightarrow \vv{r_1}, f\left(\vv{b_2}\right)
\rightarrow \vv{r_2}, f\left(\vv{b_3}\right) \rightarrow(\vv{b_3})$ is returned.
Like the Dot Angle method, a star mapping procedure is not required because each individual star is identified
at query time.

The running time of this algorithm $T_{pyramid}$ is depicted below in terms of the number of queries and the number
of entries in the $K^2$ catalog.
At most, this requires $6n^3$ catalog accesses: $3n^3$ accesses for each query step with an additional $3n^3$ accesses
for each verification step.
\begin{equation}
    T_{pyramid} = \bigO \left( n^3 \cdot \log( m_2 ) \right)
\end{equation}
where $m_2$ is the size of the $K^2$ catalog.

This entire method is specified in~\autoref{algorithm:pyramidIdentification}.

\subsection{Composite Pyramid Method}\label{subsec:compositePyramidMethod}
In 2014, Toloei developed the Novel Stars ID method, which retains all of the key aspects of Motari's
Pyramid method but uses the features from Cole and Crassidus's Planar Triangle method for the query and reference steps
instead of angles~\cite{Composite}.
This method has been adjusted to fit the general flow posed in~\autoref{subsec:genericIdentificationMethod}.

Given a set of stars from the image $I$, $d = 3$ stars are selected in same manner as the Pyramid method to obtain
the $b$ set.
From here, the process to obtain the $R$ set is the same as the triangle methods: use $P_{a, \imath}$ and $b$ to select
all candidates from $K^3$.
If the current $R$ set meets the same $\abs{R} = 1$ criterion, then a similar verification step to the Pyramid method
is performed with the Planar Triangle features.
Once this test has passed, the \Call{DMT}{} method is used to construct the bijection $f$ to potentially return.
The Pyramid method did not need this call as an implicit bijection was formed through its query process.
