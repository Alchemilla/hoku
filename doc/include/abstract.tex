    Star identification is an integral process toward stellar based orientation determination in spacecraft.
    Gottlieb's Angle method, Liebe's Dot Angle method, Cole and Crassidis's Spherical and Planar Triangle method,
    Motari's Pyramid method, and Toloei's Composite Pyramid method were modified to fit a general identification
    process.
    Each method was presented an artificial image, and aspects that were interchangeable among each process were
    normalized.
    Given an image with false stars, the Pyramid method has the highest average accuracy and is the fastest of the six.
    Given an image where each star's true position is distributed randomly (Gaussian noise), the Spherical Triangle
    method's accuracy is the least sensitive.
