    Star identification is the process of mapping centroids in an image to stars in a catalog.
    Gottlieb's Angle method, Liebe's Dot Angle method, Cole and Crassidis's Spherical and Planar Triangle method,
    Motari's Pyramid method, and Toloei's Composite Pyramid method are modified to fit a general identification process.
    Each method was presented an artificial image, and aspects that were interchangeable among each process were
    normalized.
    End to end analysis shows that the accuracy to efficiency ratio of each method under both Gaussian noise and
    false stars ranks as follows: Pyramid, Dot Angle, Spherical Triangle, Planar Triangle, Angle, Composite Pyramid.
