    Star identification is the process of mapping centroids in an image to stars in a catalog.
    Gottlieb's Angle method, Liebe's Dot Angle method, Cole and Crassidis's Spherical and Planar Triangle method,
    Motari's Pyramid method, and Toloei's Composite Pyramid method were modified to fit a general identification
    process.
    Each method was presented an artificial image, and aspects that were interchangeable among each process were
    normalized.
    In order of end to end running time, each method ranks as follows: Pyramid, Angle, Dot Angle, Planar Triangle,
    Spherical Triangle, Composite Pyramid.
    In order of end to end accuracy, each method ranks as follows: Pyramid, Dot Angle, Spherical Triangle, Angle,
    Planar Triangle, Composite Pyramid.
