\section{LIS Stellar Attitude Acquisition Process (Angle Method)}
The LIS Stellar Attitude Acquisition Process is a simplisitic approach to our problem. 
The Tappe Angle Method is a simplistic approach to our problem. We generate a lookup table of the separation angles $\theta$ between every distinct permutation of stars in our catalog, and directly relate the distance between the points in our image to this angle.
